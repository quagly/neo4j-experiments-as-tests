neo4j-experiments-as-tests
==========================

learning about neo4j using tests

Currently this contains cypher queries with tests validating correct results
using data about Philosophers from dbpedia.  I intend this project to include 
whatever I like to code for neo4j.  

This project is dependent on gradle.  Please install gradle to use.  Then run

> gradle test

in the root directory

## This project is my first use of these technologies

* github
* gradle
* neo4j
* spock

any feedback on my usage is appriciated.
